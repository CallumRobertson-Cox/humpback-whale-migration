# Whale Migration Predictor 

This project predicts whale migration locations using multi output models.

## Project Overview 

- **Goal** Predicts the locations of whales from input features 
- **Models** Multiple Neural Networks and a KNN model
- **Approach** Clean data making sure they are all numeric and changing the way we train a model to evaluate it.
- **Key Insight** KNN outperformed multiple Neural Networks due to whales habitual nature.

## Key Features 
- Multi-output regression for geogrphic coordinates
- Use of a standard Scalar
- Visualisation of predictions made using a globe
- Made in a jupyter notebook

## Libraries Used
- 'numpy'
- 'pandas
- 'scikit-learn'
- 'matplotlib'
- 'cartopy'
- 'tensorflow'

## Next steps
Add different machines for different Whale species
